These visualizations together provide a comprehensive overview of Airbnb listing prices, distribution, and revenue performance over time, segmented by the number of bedrooms and geographical location (zip code). The dashboard allows for both at-a-glance insights and deeper analysis into market trends, which would be valuable for hosts, guests, and market analysts.

1, Distinct Counts of Bedrooms Listings: This appears to be a simple table that shows the frequency of listings by the number of bedrooms. It helps to quickly see how many listings are available for each bedroom count, with 1-bedroom listings being the most common.

2, Average Price per Bedroom: This bar chart shows the average price for listings based on the number of bedrooms. There's a clear trend that the price increases with the number of bedrooms. Interestingly, there's a significant jump in the average price for listings with 7 bedrooms compared to those with 6.

3, Revenue for Year: This line graph indicates the total weekly revenue for the year 2016. The revenue shows an overall increasing trend throughout the year, with some fluctuations. This could be useful for understanding seasonal trends or growth over time.

4, Price per Zipcode (Map): This map is color-coded by average listing price in different zip codes. Darker colors likely indicate higher prices. The specific average prices are also labeled in the map, allowing for a quick comparison of pricing between areas.

5, Price by Zipcode (Bar Chart): This is a horizontal bar chart that presents the average price for listings in each zip code, sorted in descending order. Each zip code is represented by a different color, matching the map above for easy cross-reference.
